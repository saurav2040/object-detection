# Object Detection with PyTorch and Fastai

### This repository contains a project that demonstrates the implementation of an object detection model using PyTorch and the Fastai library.

## Introduction
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video. In this project, we will focus on building two models:

1. **Classification Model** : A model that can classify the largest object in an image.
2. **Detection Model** : A model that can predict the bounding box of the largest object in an image.
We will be using the PyTorch deep learning framework and the Fastai library, which provides a high-level and user-friendly interface for building and training deep learning models.

## Dataset
For this project, we have identified and analyzed a suitable dataset for object detection. The dataset we will be using is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.

The COCO dataset contains over 200,000 labeled images with more than 80 common object categories, such as people, vehicles, animals, and household items. This diverse and challenging dataset will allow us to train robust and generalized object detection models.

## Model Architecture
We will be using the Single Shot Detector (SSD) architecture for both the classification and detection models. SSD is a popular and efficient object detection model that can achieve high accuracy while running in real-time.

The SSD model consists of a base convolutional network (e.g., VGG or ResNet) followed by additional convolutional layers that generate bounding box predictions and class probabilities at multiple scales. This allows the model to detect objects of different sizes within the same image.

## Training and Evaluation
We will train and evaluate the classification and detection models using the Fastai library, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing the training process and monitoring the model's performance.

During the training, we will use techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. We will also implement appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the models' accuracy and reliability.

### Usage
To use this project, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts provided. The code will guide you through the process of loading the dataset, defining the models, training the models, and evaluating their performance.
